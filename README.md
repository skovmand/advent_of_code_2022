My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) :heart:

## Run with your own puzzle input!

All binaries read input from stdin. Run each day by piping in your puzzle input to the binary:

```
$ cat puzzle_inputs/day1.txt | cargo run -q --bin day1

🎄🎄🎄🎄 Day 1, Part 2 🎄🎄🎄🎄
